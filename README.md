# C++ Build Process Cheat Sheet

This guide simplifies the C++ build process, explaining compilation, linking, and related concepts clearly. It is structured to help you understand each step, with practical examples and detailed comments.

## **1. Compiling Source Files into Object Files**

The `-c` flag tells the compiler to **compile the source code into object files** without linking.

```bash
g++ -c main.cpp -o main.o   # Compile main.cpp into main.o
g++ -c math_utils.cpp -o math_utils.o   # Compile math_utils.cpp into math_utils.o
```

- Each `.cpp` file is compiled independently into an object file (`.o`).
- Object files contain machine code but are not yet combined into an executable.

---

## **2. Linking Object Files into an Executable**

The linker combines object files and resolves external symbols (like function calls between files).

```bash
g++ main.o math_utils.o -o my_program   # Link object files into an executable
./my_program   # Run the executable
```

- This step creates the final executable `my_program`.
- The linker resolves references (like function calls) across the object files.

## **Detailed Build Process**

### **Step 1: Preprocessing**

The preprocessor handles `#include` directives and macro expansions.

```bash
g++ -E main.cpp -o main.i
```

- Generates `main.i`, where all `#include` directives are expanded.
- Macros are replaced with their values.
- Comments are removed.

### **Step 2: Compilation**

The compiler translates preprocessed code into assembly language.

```bash
g++ -S main.i -o main.s
```

- Produces `main.s`, an assembly language file.
- Still human-readable but closer to machine code.

### **Step 3: Assembling**

The assembler converts assembly code into machine code (object file).

```bash
g++ -c main.s -o main.o
```

- Generates `main.o`, containing binary machine code.
- This is the actual code that will run on the processor.

### **Step 4: Linking**

The linker combines object files into a final executable.

```bash
g++ main.o math_utils.o -o my_program
```

- Resolves symbols (like external function calls).
- Produces the final executable `my_program`.

## **Automating the Build with a Makefile**

A `Makefile` simplifies and automates the build process:

```Makefile
all: my_program

my_program: main.o math_utils.o
	g++ main.o math_utils.o -o my_program

main.o: main.cpp
	g++ -c main.cpp -o main.o

math_utils.o: math_utils.cpp
	g++ -c math_utils.cpp -o math_utils.o

clean:
	rm -f *.o my_program
```

- Run `make` to build the project.
- Run `make clean` to remove object files and the executable.

---

## **Static vs Dynamic Linking**

### **Static Linking**

- Libraries are embedded into the executable.
- Larger executable but doesn't rely on external libraries at runtime.

```bash
g++ main.o math_utils.o -static -o my_program
```

### **Dynamic Linking**

- Links to shared libraries that are loaded at runtime.
- Results in a smaller executable but requires the shared libraries to be present.

```bash
g++ main.o math_utils.o -o my_program -lm
```

- `-lm` links against the math library (libm).

---

## **Summary**

1. **Preprocessing**: Handle `#include` and macros → `main.i`
2. **Compilation**: Convert to assembly → `main.s`
3. **Assembling**: Generate machine code (object file) → `main.o`
4. **Linking**: Combine object files into an executable → `my_program`

Understanding each step helps in debugging build errors and optimizing the build process. Use `Makefile` for efficient automation, and choose between static or dynamic linking based on your needs.
